            aggregated data does not identify users individually, and may be made available to employers or fellow job

            policy of both companies which will be published on the co-branded sites. We may disclose to third parties
            information that we have collected from other websites.</p>

        <p>Policy For Private Resume Database Hosting</p>
        <p>KARYYA.COM provides a variety of services to its customers related to hosting private databases, and the use
            of certain KARYYA.COM applications in connection with such databases. These Hosted Databases are hosted by
            KARYYA.COM, but KARYYA.COM does not own the data in the Hosted Databases or submitted to our applications.
            These Hosted Databases may contain personal information about individuals, including candidates for
            employment and existing employees of our customers. Such data may include contact details, work history,
            educational history, work preferences, and other data, depending on the particular customer and application
            at issue, and, in some instances, may include personally identifiable information ("Personal Information").
            KARYYA.COM provides hosting space to the customers who own these Databases and utilize our applications on
            such data, and KARYYA.COM therefore conduct its activities strictly in accordance with the customer
            instructions and pursuant to KARYYA.COM’s contractual arrangements with them. KARYYA.COM’s customers act as
            data controllers with respect to all such Hosted Databases. The data in such databases, including any such
            data submitted to our applications, is subject to the customer’s privacy policies. If you are a candidate
            for employment with one of our customers, you should refer to the customer's Terms & conditions / Privacy
            page on their career site to understand the terms and privacy practices that apply to your data. Moreover,
            if you would like to access and review your Personal Information, you should contact our customer with any
            such requests. We will cooperate as appropriate with requests from our customers to assist with such
            responses. KARYYA.COM is not responsible for its customer’s privacy policies or practices.</p>
        <p>An Important Note about Your Resume</p>
        <p>We give you the option of putting your resume in our database. </p>
        <p>When you create or post a resume to the Sites, that resume is stored in our searchable resume database. You
            may control the status of your resume through setting.</p>
        <p>You can store your resume in our database, but not allow it to be searchable by potential employers or
            recruiters. Not allowing your resume to be searchable means that you can use it to apply for a job online,
            but employers and recruiters will not have access to search it through our resume database product. </p>
        <p>If you set your resume as private, it is not searchable by potential employers or other with access to our
            resume database. You may still use your resume to apply online to a job.</p>
        <p>If you do apply online to a job with a Private resume, your resume will be transferred to the relevant
            employer, who may retain a copy of your resume. </p>
        <p>If you set your resume as public, but want your contact information to be confidential, your resume will be
            searchable by potential employers, but we will hide your contact information and current company. You must
            also remove your contact information from your uploaded or copy and paste text resume. You should be aware
            that if you have a rare skill or job title, for example, it may still be possible for you to be identified
            even without your contact details being included. If you are worried about being identified, you should not
            include specific details by which you could be identified. If you use a confidential resume to apply to a
            job online, the employer to whom you send your resume will be able to view your contact information in order
            to contact you about your application.</p>
        <p>If you allow your resume to be searchable without making it confidential, then all parties with access to our
            searchable resume database (or copies thereof) will have access to your resume. Employers or other parties
            with access to our searchable resume database may be located in countries whose data protection legislation
            may not be equivalent to the laws in your country. For example, your resume may be viewed and accessed by
            employers outside the Indian Jurisdiction Area who have access to our searchable database. By making your
            resume searchable, you are expressly consenting to such transfers of data. </p>
        <p>We attempt to limit access to our searchable resume database to legitimate users such as paying employers,
            recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters and human resource professionals, as well as law enforcement and
            national security agencies, but cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to this database.
            We cannot control the use made of resumes by third parties who access such resumes while they are in our
            searchable database. You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time; details of how to
            do this are given below. However, employers, recruiters and others who have paid for access to that
            database, as well as parties who have otherwise gained access to the database may have retained a copy of
            your resume in their own files or databases. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that parties other than
            those mentioned above will not, without our consent, gain access to this database. However KARYYA.COM is not
            responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of resumes by any third parties. We cannot control the
            retention, use or privacy of resumes or profiles that have been downloaded by third parties. Accordingly,
            you should not put sensitive information, personality profiles, or other information you would not want made
            public, in your resume.</p>

            resume as private unless you have previously sent to us your written consent that we may process your
            sensitive personal data, if KARYYA.COM determines this to be a requirement of applicable law. If your resume
            does contain such data and you set your resume as public, then you agree that we may retain this information
            and use it in accordance with this Statement. We cannot control third parties' access to such information

        <p>Web Beacons: KARYYA.COM Web pages and the Web pages of our partners also utilize electronic images known as
            Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs, clear gifs or action tags) that allow us to collect certain
            information about user visits to these Web pages (including the number of users who have visited those
            pages), measure and improve the effectiveness of advertisements and job postings, and deliver co-branded

            information including a cookie number, time and date of page view and a description of the page on which the
            Web beacon resides. This information may be shared with third party processors for processing on behalf of

            clicked on email addresses embedded in their job ads, for example. You may deactivate JavaScript via your
            browser settings or activate it the same way. If you disable JavaScript you will not be able to use some of
